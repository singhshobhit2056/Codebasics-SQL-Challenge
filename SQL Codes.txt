Solution 1:

select distinct market 
from dim_customer
where region = 'APAC'

Solution 2: 

select round((sum(case when fiscal_year = 2021 then 1 else 0 end) - sum(case when fiscal_year = 2020 then 1 else 0 end))*100/count(fiscal_year),2) as percentage_increase
from fact_gross_price  ##FINAL ANS = 15.37##

Solution 3:

select segment, count(distinct product) as product_count
from dim_product
group by segment
order by count(distinct product) desc

Solution 4:

with cte as (
select segment, count(case when fiscal_year = 2020 then product else null end) as product_count_2020, 
count(case when fiscal_year = 2021 then product else null end) as product_count_2021
from dim_product left join fact_gross_price
on dim_product.product_code = fact_gross_price.product_code
group by segment)

select * , (product_count_2021 - product_count_2020) as difference
from cte

Solution 5:

(select fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code, product, manufacturing_cost
from 
fact_manufacturing_cost join dim_product on fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code = dim_product.product_code
order by manufacturing_cost desc limit 1)

union 

(select fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code, product, manufacturing_cost
from 
fact_manufacturing_cost join dim_product on fact_manufacturing_cost.product_code = dim_product.product_code
order by manufacturing_cost limit 1)

Solution 6:

select customer, avg(pre_invoice_discount_pct)*100 as average_discount_percentage 
from fact_pre_invoice_deductions right join dim_customer on
fact_pre_invoice_deductions.customer_code = dim_customer.customer_code
where market = 'India' and fiscal_year = 2021
group by customer

Solution 7:

select fact_gross_price.fiscal_year, month(date) month, sum(gross_price) as gross_sales_amount
from 
fact_sales_monthly join fact_gross_price on fact_sales_monthly.product_code = fact_gross_price.product_code
group by fiscal_year, month(date)
order by fact_gross_price.fiscal_year, gross_sales_amount

Solution 8:

select quarter(date) as quarter, sum(sold_quantity) as total_sold_quantity
from fact_sales_monthly
where fiscal_year = 2020
group by quarter(date)
order by total_sold_quantity

Solution 9:

with cte as(
select channel, sum(sold_quantity)/1000000 as gross_sales_mln
from dim_customer join fact_sales_monthly on dim_customer.customer_code = fact_sales_monthly.customer_code
where fiscal_year = 2021
group by channel)

select *, round(gross_sales_mln*100/(select sum(gross_sales_mln) from cte),2) as percentage
from cte 

Solution 10:

with cte as (
select division, product, sum(sold_quantity) as total_sold_quantity, 
rank() over(partition by division order by sum(sold_quantity) desc) as rank1
from 
dim_product join fact_sales_monthly on dim_product.product_code = fact_sales_monthly.product_code
where fiscal_year = 2021
group by division, product)

select *
from cte
where rank1 < 4
